      <h2>The Murmuring Mist</h2>
      <p>At unpredictable intervals, a dense mist weaves through the streets, whispering secrets, dreams, and lies to any caught within it. Those touched by the mist may be blessed or cursed with visions, split into fragments of their former selves, or left to wander as paranoid shadows of their true selves.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Dreamblight</h2>
      <p>An affliction of both body and soul, the Dreamblight reshapes its victims according to their deepest terrors and desires. A form of dark alchemy unfolds, leaving behind grotesque transformations that grant power in return for peace of mind. This change is a haunting reminder that in Wraithhold, nothing is free.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Phantasmal Parasites</h2>
      <p>Invisible beings latch onto minds, feeding on fear and twisting perception. Infected inhabitants see things that others cannot, or fail to see the real dangers before them. Their hosts become prisoners of warped realities, unable to separate the city’s horrors from the echoes in their own minds.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Crystal Plague</h2>
      <p>Strange, crystalline growths erupt from the skin of those tainted by the gardens, forming a delicate yet lethal armor. While these crystalline outgrowths grant resilience and power, they come at the cost of physical pain and a creeping rigidity of the soul that leads its victims towards petrification.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Abyssal Corruption</h2>
      <p>A dark energy from unseen depths, the Abyssal Corruption twists everything it touches. Those exposed find themselves endowed with shadowed gifts but slowly lose their sanity to a darkness that hungers to consume them whole.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Luminous Rot</h2>
      <p>In the city’s darkest corners, a bioluminescent infection known as the Luminous Rot spreads, causing glowing spores to take root in flesh. The infected emit a dim light, attracting the gaze of both ally and foe, yet every spark brings closer a rotting transformation that disintegrates all that is human.</p>
