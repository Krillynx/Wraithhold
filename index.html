      <p>Wraithhold is a city of towering, unyielding perfection, its grand architecture reaching ever upward as if to touch the eternal stars that crown its midnight skies. Though its Baroque facades are etched with elaborate carvings and symbols from a lost time, not a crack mars its flawless walls, not a mote of dust disturbs its hallowed streets. The silence here is a weight, broken only by echoes that belong to no discernable source—footsteps, whispers, the scrape of metal or claw. And yet, Wraithhold is not empty. Something stirs within the city’s labyrinthine depths, things that slink through corridors unseen, as if they were but another shadow cast by the glimmering city lights.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To walk through Wraithhold is to feel the grip of timelessness and the whispers of endless secrets buried within its foundation. Hope and dread are constant companions, as inhabitants struggle to survive, to explore, and to unearth the city’s true nature. Here, morality is but a fickle torch, swaying in the cold winds of survival. Bound by a mysterious power, souls cannot leave, bound in a city that bends but never breaks, that waits but never reveals all its secrets.</p>
