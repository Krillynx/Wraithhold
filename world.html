      <h2>World Setting</h2>
      <p>Wraithhold is a city that defies the conventions of reality. Encased within a sprawling labyrinth of towering architecture, it exists in a realm unmoored from time, where day and night hold no meaning, and the sky shimmers with a static field of stars that have never known motion. No maps chart its expanse, for Wraithhold is an enigma to all who tread its streets. Paths seem to shift subtly when unobserved, and what once was a known route may spiral into unfamiliar depths upon return. Its boundaries, if they exist, have never been reached, leaving its inhabitants in perpetual speculation as to whether Wraithhold is a city, a prison, or a world unto itself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The city whispers its secrets to those who will listen, though answers rarely come in expected forms. The origins of Wraithhold are shrouded in myth and conjecture, but one thing is certain: no one enters it by choice, and no one escapes its grasp. Souls are drawn here, ripped from their own realities and stitched into the fabric of this place by an unseen force. It is said the city itself hungers for the vitality of those trapped within, feeding off their struggle, their despair, and their defiance. Yet, it does not consume them entirely. Instead, it grants them a peculiar gift—a form of immortality tied to the Soul Pyres scattered throughout its expanse. Death, in Wraithhold, is a temporary state, though each return from the brink comes with a price paid in fragments of one’s self.</p>

      <h2>A Living Labyrinth</h2>
      <p>Wraithhold is no mere collection of buildings; it is a living entity, though its will remains an enigma. Its structures breathe with a presence, and its architecture feels both ancient and unnervingly pristine. Towering spires pierce the heavens, etched with symbols and carvings that no one can decipher. Streets wind into intricate patterns, some forming mazes so dense that few who enter emerge unchanged.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some locations seem to hold their own sentience, exerting influence over those who wander into their sphere. The Grand Basilica of Silence, for example, dampens all sound and thought, leaving visitors with the impression they are being observed—or judged. The Obsidian Spire, on the other hand, exudes an almost magnetic pull, drawing those with unshakable resolve or reckless curiosity to its impenetrable walls. The Crystal Gardens bloom with impossible beauty, their glowing vines offering both temptation and peril to all who dare tread within.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Between these landmarks lie countless districts, each cloaked in its own mysteries. Some teem with ghostly activity, phantoms performing mundane tasks as if unaware of their own deaths. Others are barren and oppressive, filled only with the whispers of the wind and the sensation of eyes that are never found. The deeper one delves, the stranger the city becomes. Spaces defy geometry, with staircases leading to nowhere and doors opening onto vast, impossible vistas. Wraithhold resists understanding, its very essence a challenge to those who seek to unravel it.</p>
