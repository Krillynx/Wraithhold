      <h2>A Fate worse than Death</h2>
      <p>In Wraithhold, death is a pause, not an end. Upon entering, each soul is bound to Soul Pyres scattered throughout the city. When death claims a wanderer, it is but a momentary slip; they awaken at their last pyre, whole in body but fractured in mind. Each return erodes a piece of sanity, an offering to the city’s dark grasp that turns the living slowly Hollow—empty vessels whose memories and selves drain like sand through fingers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Escape from this endless cycle is a whispered myth, for none have truly departed, though some are simply gone—souls erased from the pyres’ hold by forces as mysterious as the city itself. There are other fates rumored to be worse than even this hollowing: the void beneath the Shattered Bridge, where light and memory vanish, or the hands of cosmic horrors who imprison souls in endless dread.</p>
