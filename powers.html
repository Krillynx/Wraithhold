      <p><i>Whispering Ears:</i> A gift of the Murmuring Mist, these heightened senses allow inhabitants to perceive the faintest sound. Yet, the whispering never ceases, driving most to paranoia.</p>
      <br>
      <p><i>Haunted Vision:</i> Those touched by Phantasmal Parasites gain the unsettling gift of haunted vision, seeing fragments of past and future, though reality slips ever further away.</p>
      <br>
      <p><i>Shadowmeld:</i> Abyssal corruption allows one to merge with shadows, granting near invisibility. However, the longer they linger, the more the shadows become a part of them, swallowing memories and identity.</p>
      <br>
      <p><i>Photosynthetic Healing:</i> The Luminous Rot imbues one with the ability to draw strength from light, regenerating wounds, yet this light only hastens the infectionâ€™s slow, inevitable transformation.</p>
      <br>
      <p><i>Void Pulse:</i> Voidscar victims can unleash destructive energy that consumes all in its path. Each pulse leaves them weaker, a fragment closer to an end they can feel but never reach.</p>
