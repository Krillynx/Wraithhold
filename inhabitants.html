      <h2>Inhabitants and Survivors</h2>
      <p>The denizens of Wraithhold are as varied as the worlds they hail from. Pulled from countless realities, they retain fragments of their former lives, though these memories are hazy like a forgotten dream or a words at the tip of your tongue. Each inhabitant carries the weight of their survival—or lack thereof—in ways that manifest physically, mentally, or spiritually. Some adapt to the city’s challenges, forming tenuous communities in its safer corners. Others succumb to despair, wandering aimlessly or throwing themselves into the city’s many dangers in the hope of a final end.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>The Hollows</h2>
      <p>Among Wraithhold’s most pitiable denizens are the Hollows: individuals who have succumbed to death and resurrection too many times. With each return from the Soul Pyres, a fragment of their sanity, identity, and essence is stripped away, until nothing of their former selves remains. These husks wander the city aimlessly, driven by primal instincts or repeating meaningless fragments of past lives like broken records. Unaltered by the more overt phenomena that plague Wraithhold, the Hollows stand as haunting reminders of the cost of immortality without purpose. They are both feared and pitied, lingering specters of what any resident might become.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>The Remnants of the First and Second Wave</h2>
      <p>The so-called Remnants are the most enigmatic of Wraithhold’s inhabitants, having endured the city since its earliest days. These individuals hail from the first and second waves of arrivals, their survival a testament to their resourcefulness—or their willingness to embrace the city's darkest bargains. Time has warped them in ways both physical and psychological; many have undergone profound transformations, their forms often unrecognizable as what they once were. Yet their knowledge of Wraithhold’s secrets is unparalleled, and their presence is a chilling reminder of the price paid for persistence.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>The Wraithbound</h2>
      <p>Inhabitants who succumb to Wraithhold’s phenomena without becoming Hollows are often called the Wraithbound. These individuals are no longer wholly themselves, their bodies and minds reshaped by the forces at play. Some gain grotesque powers at the cost of their morality, their forms shifting to reflect their innermost fears or desires. Others become conduits for the city’s will, puppets to its unknowable intent. The Wraithbound are often as much a danger to others as they are to themselves, their transformations at times leaving them unrecognizable to the people they once were.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>The Eternals</h2>
      <p>The term Eternals refers not to inhabitants in the traditional sense but to entities seemingly born of Wraithhold itself. Unlike the transient souls trapped within the city, Eternals appear ageless, existing outside the cycles of life, death, and resurrection. They are neither wholly alive nor entirely dead, their forms woven from the same ethereal essence that permeates the city. Some believe the Eternals are guardians, enforcing the city’s enigmatic rules, while others see them as arbiters of balance, punishing transgressions or rewarding those who act according to its hidden morality. Their motives are inscrutable, and their appearances often herald profound change—or destruction.</p>
